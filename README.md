# C plus plus Program
Airgead Banking Project 2 

# What did you do particularly well?
For this project, I think I did particularly well with providing the user with clear prompts for the user to enter the initial investment, monthly deposit, annual interest rate. As well as, the nested loops for calculating interest. Creating two loops was difficult but it was the right move to allow for accurate monthly compounding. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would enhance my code by making it more visually pleasing. While the code was functional when I was reviewing it for this repository, I did find some spelling errors in my in line comments. I could have also used more classes to help organize the code, rather than writing it all in the main.cpp. That would have better prepared me for Project 3 where we needed to create multiple classes for one program. Focusing more on the UX/UI would have helped me make this more appealing. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
For me, calculating the yearly interest with monthly deposits was the most challenging part for me. It took several attempts to figure out the right equation. In my initial tries, I was only calculating interest at the end of the year, rather than after each month. Eventually, I decided to use nested for loops, one for the years and another for the months. After the inner loop, which calculates the monthly interest, runs 12 times, I print out the current balance as a yearly report before resetting the monthly loop for the next year.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think the transferable skills from this project include the understanding of proper naming, input handling, and output formatting. This project was great practice at using these skills which will be used for many years to come. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Using in line comments helped me the most at making sure this program was maintainable, readable and adaptable. With my main.cpp being so long in line comments were crucial for helping the user navigate and understand what the function of the program is.
