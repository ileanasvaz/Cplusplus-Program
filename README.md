# C-Program
Airgead Banking Project 2 

# What did you do particularly well?
For this project, I think I did particularly well on the calculations for compounding interest without monthly deposits. 

One thing that I feel I did particularly well was my calculation for the monthly compounding interest. It took me several tries to figure out how to come out with the correct numbers, as in my first few attempts I was only calculating the interest added at the end of each year rather than at the end of each month. Eventually, I decided to use nested for loops, one for the years of the deposit and one for the months. After the loop that adds monthly iterates 12 times, the current amounts are printed as a yearly report before the monthly loop resets with the next year.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would enhance my code by making it more visually pleasing. While the code was functional when I was reviewing it for this repository, I did find many spelling errors in my in line comments. Fortunately, I did receive an 100% on this project but there are improvements to be made for the UX to be made more appealing.
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found calculating the yearly interest to be the hardest. I went back to my readings to 
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think this project helped me to feel more comfortable with declaring and defining classes, as this was the first assignment in which we had to do so on our own. Being comfortable with this was extremely helpful for approaching project 3.
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
